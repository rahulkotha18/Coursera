1. List the city, state, and zip codes in the customer table.  Your result should not have duplicates. (Hint: The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicates.)

	select distinct city,state,zip from Customer;


2. List the name, department, phone number, and email address of employees with a phone number beginning with “3-”.

	select empname,department,phone,email from Employee where phone Like "3-%";


3. List all columns of the resource table with a rate between $10 and $20. Sort the result by rate.


	select * from ResoureTbl where rate between '10' and '20' order by rate;


4. List the event requests with a status of “Approved” or “Denied” and an authorized date in July 2018. Include the event number, authorization date, and status in the output. (Hint: see the examples in Module 4 for date constants in Oracle and MySQL.)

	select eventno,dateauth,status from EventRequest where status in ('approved','denied') and dateauth between '2018-07-01' and '2018-07-31';


5. List the location number and name of locations that are part of the “Basketball arena”.  Your WHERE clause should not have a condition involving the facility number compared to a constant (“F101”). Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value of “Basketball arena”.


	select locno,locname from Location where facno IN(select facno from Facility where facname = 'Basketball arena');


6. For each event plan, list the plan number, count of the event plan lines, and sum of the number of resources assigned.  For example, plan number “P100” has 4 lines and 7 resources assigned.  You only need to consider event plans that have at least one line.


 	select planno,count(*)as line, sum(numberfld) from EventPlanLine group by planno having count(*) > 1;
